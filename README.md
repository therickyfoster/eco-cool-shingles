## Overview

**EcoCool Roof Shingles™** are **innovative, self-cooling roofing tiles** that reduce household and building energy costs while actively **capturing CO₂ and pollutants**.  

Combining **high-reflectivity surfaces, evaporative cooling channels, and a mycelium-biochar core**, these shingles **lower indoor temperatures by up to 7°C (12.6°F)** without additional power usage, making them ideal for **hot climates, urban heat islands, and eco-conscious builders**.

---

## Core Features

- **Passive Cooling** – Reflects sunlight and channels airflow to cool buildings naturally.  
- **Pollution Capture** – Mycelium-biochar layer filters airborne particulates and binds carbon.  
- **Energy Savings** – Cuts **air conditioning usage by 30–50%**, saving homeowners $200–$800/year.  
- **Durable & Low-Cost** – Produced from recycled composites and bio-based resins.  
- **Modular Design** – Compatible with **existing roofing infrastructure** for easy retrofitting.

---

## How It Works

1. **Reflective Top Layer** – Bounces up to **90% of solar radiation**, reducing heat gain.  
2. **Ventilation Channels** – Embedded airflow tunnels create a **chimney effect**, naturally cooling the roof.  
3. **Mycelium-Biochar Core** – Traps pollutants (PM2.5, microplastics) and sequesters carbon while insulating.  
4. **Moisture Retention System** – In humid climates, condensation is captured to boost evaporative cooling.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Recycled plastics and bio-resins (outer layers).  
  - Biochar and mycelium composite (core).  
  - Aluminum or ceramic reflective coating.

- **Production**:  
  - Made with **standard roofing tile molds**; scalable via existing factories.  
  - Cost to produce: **$3–$4 per shingle**.  
  - Retail price: **$5–$8 per shingle**, competitive with premium roofing.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Can be **distributed globally through construction supply chains**.  
  - DAO-integrated model funds local production facilities for emerging markets.

---

## Use Cases

- **Residential & Commercial Roofing** – Reduce cooling costs and emissions.  
- **Urban Retrofit Projects** – Combat heat islands while cleaning city air.  
- **Emergency & Off-Grid Shelters** – Provide cooling without electricity.  
- **Eco-Resorts & Green Developments** – Aesthetic, sustainable roofing.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Each **1,000 ft² roof**:  
  - Offsets **~1 ton of CO₂ annually** via the biochar-mycelium core.  
  - Saves **1,500–3,000 kWh/year** in energy (reducing grid emissions).  
  - Reduces **urban heat island effect**, improving local air quality.

- Shingles are **fully recyclable and biodegradable at end of life**.

## Market Strategy

- **Primary Market**: Eco-conscious homeowners, green builders, and city retrofit programs.  
- **Sales Channels**:  
  - Home improvement stores and green building distributors.  
  - Direct-to-consumer kits for DIY roof upgrades.  
  - Partnerships with roofing contractors for bulk installation.

- **Selling Points**:  
  - **Immediate cost savings on energy bills**.  
  - Government incentives for green building adoption.  
  - **Low upfront cost, high ROI** compared to solar panels or standard “cool roofs”.

Projected **profit margin**: 40–60% (competitive pricing with sustainable edge).

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (2025 Q3)**  
- Finalize prototype testing for cooling efficiency and pollutant capture.  
- Begin pilot installs in **Arizona, Dubai, and Singapore** (heat-stressed cities).  

**Phase 2 (2025 Q4)**  
- Partner with **construction suppliers** for mass distribution.  
- Secure **tax credit recognition and LEED certification**.

**Phase 3 (2026)**  
- Expand into **modular building kits** and **disaster-resilient shelter programs**.  
- Integrate with **smart climate networks** for city-scale deployment.
